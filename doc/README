
By default, the script makes use of a content class with the identifier "blog_post" to import your WordPress posts. However, you can change the class
used for importing the posts by using the --post-class command line option.

The eZ Publish content class for blog posts should exist at least of the following attributes:
- title     ezstring
- body      ezxmltext
- leader    ezxmltext

By default, the script imports posts under the content node with ID 2, which is the root node of the content tree on an out-of-the-box eZ Publish
installation.  However, you can change the parent node for blog posts by using the --parent-node command line option.
